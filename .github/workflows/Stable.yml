# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.


# Readme - Actions work from a temporary directory. If the repo's project is not in root repo folder
# there must be a cd ./<directory where project is> ran for each command annotated.
# <- hash here specifies comments and should be excluded from example below.
# To specify multiple command -> run: |
#                                     Then 1st command
#                                     Then 2nd command
