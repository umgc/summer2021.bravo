# Harkify
This project is being designed for memory assistance among elderly and dementia patients. The application is a note taking system that uses voice recording services to write down information relayed by the user.  These notes are stored, searchable by content and organized to facilitate in conversation organization and information retention. Wake commands will also be integrated into the system so that the user can tell the applcation when they should be listening.
